# Introduction

MICAL is a simple, line-oriented configuration language. It is designed to be flat, explicit, and easy to read.

Unlike complex hierarchical formats, MICAL treats configuration as a linear sequence of key-value pairs, grouped visually but remaining logically flat.

This documentation guides you through installing the MICAL tools and understanding the language specification.
